# appserver

The latest iteration of the appserver. Written in swift using Kitura. Doesn't really function yet, but need to keep it working on macOS and Linux.

On ubuntu, requires libcurl3-gnutls-dev and libpq-dev installed.

## Testing

If docker is not located at  `/usr/local/bin/docker`  on your systerm, specify the path in the DOCKER_EXE environment variable before running the tests.
